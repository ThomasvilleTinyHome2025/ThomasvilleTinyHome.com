Perfect! Now let's get your website uploaded to Vercel. Here's exactly what to do:

## Upload Your Website to Vercel

### **Step 1: Download Your Project First**

Before uploading to Vercel, you need the project file:

1. **Click this attachment**: `manus-webdev://456f58b9` (I sent it earlier)
2. It will download as a ZIP file
3. **Unzip/Extract** it to a folder on your computer
4. You should see a folder called `thomasville-tiny-homes`

### **Step 2: Upload to Vercel**

Now you're in your Vercel dashboard. Here's what to do:

#### **Option A: Direct Upload (Easiest)**

Unfortunately, Vercel doesn't support direct folder uploads anymore. You need to use **GitHub** or **CLI**.

#### **Option B: Use GitHub (Recommended)**

**If you have GitHub:**
1. In Vercel, click **"Add New..."** â†’ **"Project"**
2. Click **"Import Git Repository"**
3. Connect your GitHub account
4. Push your code to GitHub first, then import

**Don't have GitHub?** That's okay, use Option C below.

#### **Option C: Use Vercel CLI (Command Line)**

This is the easiest if you don't have GitHub:

**On Windows:**
1. Press `Windows Key + R`
2. Type `cmd` and press Enter
3. Install Vercel CLI:
   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   ```
4. Navigate to your project folder:
   ```
   cd Downloads\thomasville-tiny-homes
   ```
   (Adjust path to where you extracted it)
5. Run:
   ```
   vercel login
   ```
6. Enter your email (the one you used for Vercel)
7. Check your email for login code
8. Run:
   ```
   vercel
   ```
9. Follow prompts (press Enter for defaults)
10. When done, run:
    ```
    vercel --prod
    ```

**On Mac:**
1. Open Terminal (Cmd + Space, type "Terminal")
2. Install Vercel CLI:
   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   ```
3. Navigate to your project:
   ```
   cd ~/Downloads/thomasville-tiny-homes
   ```
4. Run:
   ```
   vercel login
   ```
5. Enter your email
6. Check email for code
7. Run:
   ```
   vercel
   ```
8. Follow prompts
9. Run:
   ```
   vercel --prod
   ```

### **Step 3: Alternative - I Can Help You Deploy**

If the above is confusing, I have another option:

**Tell me:**
1. Do you have **Node.js** installed? (Type `node -v` in command prompt/terminal)
2. Are you on **Windows or Mac**?
3. Would you prefer to use **GitHub** instead?

And I'll give you the exact steps for your situation.

### **Easiest Path Forward:**

Since you're already signed up on Vercel, the **absolute easiest** way is:

1. **Create a free GitHub account** at github.com
2. **Upload your project** to GitHub (I'll show you how)
3. **Connect GitHub to Vercel** (one click)
4. **Deploy** (automatic)

This also makes future updates super easy - just push to GitHub and Vercel auto-deploys!
